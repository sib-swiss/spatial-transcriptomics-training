Mouse Brain Serial Section 1 (Sagittal-Posterior):

10x Genomics obtained fresh frozen mouse brain tissue (Strain C57BL/6) from BioIVT Asterand. The tissue was embedded and cryosectioned as described in Visium Spatial Protocols - Tissue Preparation Guide Demonstrated Protocol (CG000240). Tissue sections of 10 µm thickness from a sagittal slice of the posterior were placed on Visium Gene Expression Slides.
