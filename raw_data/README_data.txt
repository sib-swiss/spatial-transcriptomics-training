Fresh Frozen Visium on CytAssist: Mouse Brain, Probe-Based Whole Transcriptome Profiling

Spatial Gene Expression Dataset by Space Ranger 2.0.1
10x Genomics obtained fresh frozen (FF) mouse brain tissue blocks from Avaden Biosciences. The tissue was sectioned as described in Visium CytAssist Spatial Gene Expression for Fresh Frozen – Tissue Preparation Guide Demonstrated Protocol (CG000636). Tissue section of 10 µm was placed on a standard glass slide, and H&E-stained following methanol fixation. Sections were coverslipped with 85% glycerol, imaged, decoverslipped, followed by destaining as described in Visium CytAssist Spatial Gene Expression for Fresh Frozen – Fixation, H&E Staining, Imaging & Destaining Demonstrated Protocol (CG000614). The glass slide with tissue section was processed via Visium CytAssist instrument to transfer analytes to a Visium CytAssist Spatial Gene Expression slide with 6.5 mm Capture Area following the Visium CytAssist Spatial Gene Expression Reagent Kits for FFPE User Guide (CG000495). RIN Score: 7.0
